# Abstract Insights

- In this project, a deep learning model was developed to classify sentences in medical abstracts using the PubMed 200k
RCT dataset, efficiently categorizing sentences into roles such as objectives, methods, and results, thus facilitating faster
literature review for researchers.
- I developed a deep learning model combining pre-trained token, character, and positional embeddings through feature
engineering, achieving 83.20% accuracy and an F1 score of 0.8311.
